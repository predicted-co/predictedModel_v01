# Pizza Sales Analysis and Forecasting Model

## Project Overview
This document outlines the Pizza Sales Analysis and Forecasting Model, which leverages historical sales data to develop an AI-driven predictive model tailored for food and beverage (F&B) establishments. The primary objective is to uncover sales patterns and trends that empower businesses to enhance operational efficiency and optimize inventory management.

## Key Features
- Comprehensive analysis of daily sales patterns
- Visualization of order frequency segmented by day of the week
- Machine learning-based sales forecasting
- Interactive data visualization capabilities

## Data Source
The model utilizes historical pizza sales data sourced from `data/raw/pizzasales.csv`, which includes:
- Order dates
- Sales volumes
- Day of the week patterns

## Implementation Details
The analysis is conducted using Python, incorporating the following libraries:
- **Pandas**: For efficient data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib**: For creating visual representations of data
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: For developing predictive models

### Core Components:
1. Data preprocessing and cleaning
2. Time series analysis
3. Pattern recognition methodologies
4. Sales forecasting techniques

## Usage Instructions
1. Ensure that all required dependencies are installed.
2. Place the sales data file in the `data/raw` directory.
3. Execute the Jupyter notebook `Pizza.ipynb`.
4. Review the generated visualizations and predictions.

## Expected Outcomes
